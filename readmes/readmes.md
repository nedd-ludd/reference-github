#Introduction
A README file communicates important information about you or a project and is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your profile or repository. 
It is important to give thought to its structure and length,

Why are they usefull?
Who are they for?
	For you
	for others
		people using code
		people thinking of hiring / working with you 

#What's in a README?
In a project repo, it typically includes information on:

What the project does
Why the project is useful
How users can get started with the project
Where users can get help with your project
Who maintains and contributes to the project

During aquiring and building of skills in a developer's/ engineer's initial projects, it may be useful to contain information to support/ showcase their learning:
Challenges
Key wins
Development methods
Future improvements

READMEs can also communicate expectations and help manage contributions with other files/ info like:
licence
citation file
contribution guidelines
a code of conduct

##Typical Structures

The structure should depend on the project, that said they may contain certain headings.

##General rules
If you put your README file in your repository's hidden .github, root, or docs directory, GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors.
If a repository contains more than one README file, then the file shown is chosen from locations in the following order: the .github directory, then the repository's root directory, and finally the docs directory.

As coding progresses, if keeping notes on the development lifecycle, this can contain vital information for the readme.
