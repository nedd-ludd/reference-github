## Introduction
A README file communicates important information about you or a project and is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your profile or repository. 

It is important to give thought to its structure, content, and length to showcase what you are and your project is about.

Who is going to read it? Both you and others. Consider yourself as a different person months from now, you have forgotten some/most/all of the codebase but need to revisit a project - the README can help refresh your memory. Other people might be interested in the project or YOU; they may want to work with you or hire you. Knowing who will read this should help set the tone for an appropriate standard of README deliverable.

## What is in a README?
In a project repo, it typically includes information on:

- What the project does.
- Why the project is useful.
- How users can get started with the project.
- How users can test the project.
- Where users can get help with your project.
- Who maintains and contributes to the project.

During aquiring and building of skills in a developer's/ engineer's initial projects, it may be useful to contain information to support/ showcase their learning:
- Challenges.
- Key wins.
- Brief and timescale.
- Was it solo or colab.
- Technologies used.
- Development methods.
- Future improvements.

READMEs can also communicate expectations and help manage contributions along side files/ info like:
- Licence.
- Citation file.
- Contribution guidelines.
- Code of conduct.

## Typical Structures

The structure should depend on the project, that said they may contain certain headings.

## Markdown

## Helpful Elements

images, screenshots, GIFs

## Location
If you put your README file in your repository's hidden .github, root, or docs directory, GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors.
If a repository contains more than one README file, then the file shown is chosen from locations in the following order: the .github directory, then the repository's root directory, and finally the docs directory.

## How to approach
As coding progresses, if keeping notes as the project lifecycle develops, this can contain vital information for the readme.

Start with notes and bullet points. 



Commit changes/ push regularly

## How much to write

Collapseable/ - Although difficult to manage if too many, think about putting links in key places.
Consider using a Wiki


## Tips Tricks

- Write in clear concise language. Consider it like writing a report. 
- If there is any information that is salient, differnt or interesting, put this first to save time when reading.
- Cosider tldr information at the top.
- Consider putting contact information first and saying you welcome messages. We are a community and communication is important.


## Personal READMEs

Here are below links to READMEs that I consider good/exemplar for different reasons:
